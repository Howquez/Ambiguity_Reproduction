The reproduction package is prepared to allow a "push-button reproduction" of our results. Few adjustments (if any at all) should be needed. Simply navigate open your command line tools, navigate to `source/` and execute `quarto render --to html`. Alternatively, navigate to the project file `source/source.Rproj` to open R Studio and initiate R. From within this R project, open the files you want to reproduce, e.g., `01-pre-processing.qmd` and render the file (e.g. by pressing `command` + `shift` + `k`) That's it. 

If you do not want to render the documents yourself, you can either navigate to `rendered_documents/` or visit our [github page](https://howquez.github.io/Ambiguity_Reproduction/) to view them online.

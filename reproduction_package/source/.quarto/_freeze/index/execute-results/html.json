By combining narrative explanations with code, we ensure that our analyses are fully transparent and reproducible, allowing other researchers to validate, modify, and extend our findings. While the reproduction captures the substance of all results, minor discrepancies in the style of some tables may arise due to post-processing in LaTeX. These differences do not affect the accuracy or interpretation of the findings. \n\nThe session information below provides a record of the R environment, including package versions and system details. This ensures that others can replicate the analysis under the same conditions, reducing the risk of discrepancies due to software version differences. Throughout the document, we use groundhog as a package versioning tool to maintain consistent and reproducible package versions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)\nPlatform: x86_64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Sonoma 14.4.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-x86_64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-x86_64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Zurich\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.4.1    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.3        \n [5] tools_4.4.1       htmltools_0.5.8.1 rstudioapi_0.16.0 rmarkdown_2.27   \n [9] knitr_1.48        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.46         digest_0.6.36    \n[13] rlang_1.1.4       evaluate_0.24.0  \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
